# Silent-Face-Anti-Spoofing-TFLite
This repository provides an end-to-end pipeline for face anti-spoofing using MiniFASNet models. It includes model conversion from PyTorch (.pth) to ONNX, TensorFlow, and finally TFLite. The project ensures optimized inference performance for mobile and edge devices while maintaining high accuracy.
